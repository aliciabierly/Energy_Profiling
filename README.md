# Energy Profiling Code

These scripts were developed during my internship at Apleona Ireland to streamline the energy profiling of office buildings using sensor data.

## Objective

To analyze and energy-profile office spaces by leveraging time-series data collected from building sensors.

## Problem

Traditional energy profiling required engineers to manually monitor and interpret live sensor tables to determine when energy systems were 
active. For large buildings with many sensors, this manual process could take several hours, making profiling time-consuming and inefficient.

## Solution

I developed code that automated energy profiling workflow. Rather than manually inspecting each sensor in real time, engineers can record 
the on/off timestamps for energy systems and analyze these events through generated visualizations after data collection. This approach 
significantly reduced the need for manual monitoring and enabled faster, more scalable analysis.
